# 🏄‍♂️ Segni Tsega

**Full-Stack Software Engineer**

I'm a full-stack application developer on a mission to turn coffee and code into seamless digital experiences. From front-end magic to back-end wizardry, I build everything from scratch—brainstorming wild ideas, wrangling logic, and debugging my way to victory. Whether it's crafting intuitive user interfaces or optimizing performance under the hood, I love bringing ideas to life with clean, scalable code. When I’m not deep in the matrix of development, I’m probably experimenting with new tech, automating things I probably don’t need to, or convincing my code that bugs are just “undocumented features.”

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I kicked off my coding journey in high school, mesmerized by the idea of building things from scratch. My first love? HTML. Ah yes, the "programming language" (or so I thought at the time) that made me feel like a wizard just by making a button appear on a page. I dabbled in a little CSS too, just enough to make my buttons less ugly. But before I could go full steam ahead, my nerd instincts kicked in, dragging me back to classwork.
   Then came Python. Not because I had a deep love for clean syntax or automation—nope, it was hacking. The idea of being a digital ninja sounded cool. But just like with HTML, my deep dive turned into a shallow splash because, well... grades. High school had me on a tight leash, and let’s just say I wasn’t ready to trade my straight A’s for script kiddie dreams.<br>
   Fast forward, and my focus took a serious turn towards web development. I started with frontend, met React, and it was love at first import. From there, I couldn't resist going deeper, eventually stepping into full-stack development with Node.js—all powered by my favorite language, JavaScript. There's just something about JS that keeps me hooked.<br>
   Right now, my goal is clear: master full-stack development and break into mobile development too. I want to be damn good at what I do. But one thing remains constant—I refuse to stay comfortable. If there's a limit, I push it. If there's a challenge, I tackle it. And if there’s a problem? Well, I’ll probably build an app to solve it.
